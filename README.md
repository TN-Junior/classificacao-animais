# Animal Species Image Classification
This project is dedicated to training a machine learning model to classify images of different animal species. We will use Jupyter Notebook to develop and train the model.



Introduction

Image classification is an essential task in many fields, including biology, conservation and zoology. This project uses deep learning techniques to train a model capable of identifying different species of animals from their images.
